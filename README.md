# Abstract
This report will begin with the brief introduction of blockchain technology. Then I draw forth the crowdsale, which is a new way of financing based on smart contract. I will tell what the crowdsale is, why it comes into being, and what scale it has been for recent years. And last, on the basis of understanding the theory, I take a toy implementation of smart contract on crowd sale.
